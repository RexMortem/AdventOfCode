# Advent of Code Solutions 

My various attempts at Advent of Code over the years, as I get better at programming and learn different languages!

## Reflections

From 2024 onwards, there are **reflection documents** which reflect on my solutions and how I can come up with better solutions; often for AOC, "better" solutions will be solutions that I can come up with and write quickly. Efficiency or maintainability usually doesn't matter a great deal as long as they're reasonable (run in decent time and I can read them at the time).
